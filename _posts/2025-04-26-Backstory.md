The world is left to ashes after a catastrophic event which left humanity in the brink of extinction. The nature of the catastrophe is still debated to this day, with most claiming to have been caused by a big war which ended with the use of weapons of mass destruction. The resault of this destruction was the utter destruction of the surface of the planet. Vegetation withered and died. It was impossible for any kind of organic life to survive on the surface anymore. The parts of humanity that managed to survive the destruction split into two major groups.
